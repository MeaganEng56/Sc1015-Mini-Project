# SC1015-Mini-Project: Online Retail Analysis

### Dataset Introduction
This Online Retail dataset contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
